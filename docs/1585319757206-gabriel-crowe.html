            <h1>The Logo</h1>
<p>I know that to connect with an application we use, and to have it become part of our ritual, we need something tangible to lock onto. I needed a break from coding for a while so I decided to put goether some colours and an art style for the project. I decided to make a sort of <em>mini brand</em>.</p>
<p>I thought about the way we think about the word muse and what it means. I don't mean the band Muse, although they are very good, I merely mean the inspirational types that give is direction and ideas when we are perhaps lost.</p>
<p>To me, muses are part of Greek mythology, and this is my original idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/nine-muses-in-greek-mythology/">https://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/nine-muses-in-greek-mythology/</a></p>
<h2>The muses</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clio: The Muse Clio discovered history and guitar. History was named Clio in the ancient years, because it refers to “kleos” the Greek word for the heroic acts. Clio was always represented with a clarion in the right arm and a book in the left hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Euterpe: Muse Euterpe discovered several musical instruments, courses and dialectic. She was always depicted holding a flute, while many instruments were always around her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thalia: Muse Thalia was the protector of comedy; she discovered comedy, geometry, architectural science and agriculture. She was also protector of Symposiums. She was always depicted holding a theatrical – comedy mask.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melpomene: Opposite from Thalia, Muse Melpomene was the protector of Tragedy; she invented tragedy, rhetoric speech and Melos. She was depicted holding a tragedy mask and usually bearing a bat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terpsichore: Terpsichore was the protector of dance; she invented dances, the harp and education. She was called Terpsichore because she was enjoying and having fun with dancing ( “Terpo” in Greek refers to be amused). She was depicted wearing laurels on her head, holding a harp and dancing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Erato: Muse Erato was the protector of Love and Love Poetry – as well as wedding. Her name comes from the Greek word “Eros” that refers to the feeling of falling in love. She was depicted holding a lyre and love arrows and bows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polymnia: Muse Polymnia was the protector of the divine hymns and mimic art; she invented geometry and grammar. She was depicted looking up to the Sky, holding a lyre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ourania: Muse Ourania was the protector of the celestial objects and stars; she invented astronomy. She was always depicted bearing stars, a celestial sphere and a bow compass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calliope: Muse Calliope was the superior Muse. She was accompanying kings and princes in order to impose justice and serenity. She was the protector of heroic poems and rhetoric art. According to the myth, Homer asks from Calliope to inspire him while writing Iliad and Odyssey, and, thus, Calliope is depicted holding laurels in one hand and the two Homeric poems in the other hand.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Poetry can't be written without a pen, and I love using a quill. I like the idea of code as a form of modern poetry, something we can share and read together, understand and learn from.</p>
<p>I wanted the brand to show this, and to call back to those muses, with a magical, ephemeral sort of glow.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/logo.png" alt="first sttempt at logo"></p>
<p>Each of the stars and points around the quill, represents a differnet one of the <strong>nine muses</strong>.</p>
<p>I rounded any sharp edges, because that not what this project is about, its about stress free writing, and learning from the code-poems of others.</p>
