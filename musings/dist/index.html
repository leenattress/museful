                    <p>In the museful editor, we use markdown. This means we can use the hashtag # to denote a title.</p>
<p>When the creator muses a document where the first line has a single hash, we assume this is the title and we set that in the metadata.</p>
<p>I think this is a nice quality of life feature, and this means that the markdown API returns the title, in the JSON response.</p>

<p>I've taken a little break in coding museful, mainly due to the coronavirus pandemic that is gripping the nation, but now I'm back. I've bought myself a new keyboard, a mechanical one that makes wonderful sounds when I type, so typing is fun again! So let's get back on it.</p>
<p>A new theme is born from the one I created for plix, and I've called it <strong>committed</strong>.</p>
<p><code>git commit -m 'created a clever theme name based around a git command'</code></p>
<p>It's a rework in that it is stripped of all the social and other clutter, and I've made those elements present in the source HTML, merely commented out, for future template editing, when you may want them back in. It also includes customizable navigation and some fun header images and such.</p>
<p>It shares the dark blue of the admin theme, and this can be easily configured using the museful.json found in your musings folder.</p>

<p>This time I needed to make sure the pane on the left where you type your markdown is always the height it should be even after you toggle the preview on, because it lengthens and shortes it based on the width.</p>

<p>Developers need to be aware that, when you contribute thoughts to museful, you are actually putting them into the source repository and that these markdown files, though prepared in a web interface, will be checked over by your comrades for errors and omissions.</p>
<p>These files though, the thoughts, I want them to be less <em>reviewed</em> as <em>enjoyed</em>. I want others on your team to see your process while you were coding and learn from it, or even, disagree if that's their bag.</p>
<p>Either way, my opinion is that these are places for dreamers and idea people.</p>
<p>It's perfectly OK for developers not to contribute musings. I just hope they sometimes read them.</p>

<h2>I've solved a problem</h2>
<p>Reading and creating markdown files in nodejs.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">app.post(&quot;/musings&quot;, async function(req, res) {

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
<p>It is possible to create an API that does not have a database behind it, but merely any other kind of store. In this case, I can CRUD text files that are in fact markdown.</p>
<p>We expose this functionality though a REST api, and it looks like we are dealing with a data service or some kind, but actually, its just files.</p>

                    <h1>The Logo</h1>
<p>I know that to connect with an application we use, and to have it become part of our ritual, we need something tangible to lock onto. I needed a break from coding for a while so I decided to put goether some colours and an art style for the project. I decided to make a sort of <em>mini brand</em>.</p>
<p>I thought about the way we think about the word muse and what it means. I don't mean the band Muse, although they are very good, I merely mean the inspirational types that give is direction and ideas when we are perhaps lost.</p>
<p>To me, muses are part of Greek mythology, and this is my original idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/nine-muses-in-greek-mythology/">https://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/nine-muses-in-greek-mythology/</a></p>
<h2>The muses</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clio: The Muse Clio discovered history and guitar. History was named Clio in the ancient years, because it refers to “kleos” the Greek word for the heroic acts. Clio was always represented with a clarion in the right arm and a book in the left hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Euterpe: Muse Euterpe discovered several musical instruments, courses and dialectic. She was always depicted holding a flute, while many instruments were always around her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thalia: Muse Thalia was the protector of comedy; she discovered comedy, geometry, architectural science and agriculture. She was also protector of Symposiums. She was always depicted holding a theatrical – comedy mask.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melpomene: Opposite from Thalia, Muse Melpomene was the protector of Tragedy; she invented tragedy, rhetoric speech and Melos. She was depicted holding a tragedy mask and usually bearing a bat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terpsichore: Terpsichore was the protector of dance; she invented dances, the harp and education. She was called Terpsichore because she was enjoying and having fun with dancing ( “Terpo” in Greek refers to be amused). She was depicted wearing laurels on her head, holding a harp and dancing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Erato: Muse Erato was the protector of Love and Love Poetry – as well as wedding. Her name comes from the Greek word “Eros” that refers to the feeling of falling in love. She was depicted holding a lyre and love arrows and bows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polymnia: Muse Polymnia was the protector of the divine hymns and mimic art; she invented geometry and grammar. She was depicted looking up to the Sky, holding a lyre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ourania: Muse Ourania was the protector of the celestial objects and stars; she invented astronomy. She was always depicted bearing stars, a celestial sphere and a bow compass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calliope: Muse Calliope was the superior Muse. She was accompanying kings and princes in order to impose justice and serenity. She was the protector of heroic poems and rhetoric art. According to the myth, Homer asks from Calliope to inspire him while writing Iliad and Odyssey, and, thus, Calliope is depicted holding laurels in one hand and the two Homeric poems in the other hand.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Poetry can't be written without a pen, and I love using a quill. I like the idea of code as a form of modern poetry, something we can share and read together, understand and learn from.</p>
<p>I wanted the brand to show this, and to call back to those muses, with a magical, ephemeral sort of glow.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/logo-test.png" alt="first sttempt at logo"></p>
<p>Each of the stars and points around the quill, represents a differnet one of the <strong>nine muses</strong>.</p>
