# window.setTimeout madness

Honestly, I hate using it, it seems to be outdated and hacky, but sometimes frameworks dont do updates immediately, and this is a require hack.

This time I needed to make sure the pane on the left where you type your markdown is always the height it should be even after you toggle the preview on, because it lengthens and shortes it based on the width.

That is all, rant over, everything is _gravy_.
