Sometimes I find myself pushing my opinions of those who might use my software. In this case, I'm expecting them to write thoughtful musings on a project.

Developers need to be aware that, when you contribute thoughts to museful, you are actually putting them into the source repository and that these markdown files, though prepared in a web interface, will be checked over by your comrades for errors and omissions.

These files though, the thoughts, I want them to be less _reviewed_ as _enjoyed_. I want others on your team to see your process while you were coding and learn from it, or even, disagree if that's their bag.

Either way, my opinion is that these are places for dreamers and idea people.

It's perfectly OK for developers not to contribute musings. I just hope they sometimes read them.
